COLOUR CLASSICS CLOCK
==============================

Software Upgrade Installation
-----------------------------
1. Rename the .bin file to "firmware.bin" and copy to a Micro SD card.
2. Remove any "firmware.bak" file from the Micro SD card. (This is created from a previous software upgrade)
3. Insert the Micro SD card into the Colour Classic Clock's card reader slot and power on.
4. The CCC will install the new firmware.  On completion the file on the SD card will be renamed to "firmware.bak" to prevent the
installation from repeating. The CCC will reboot. Check the new version number is displayed on the startup screen.

Note.  If the file "firmware.bak" already exists, the rename operation will fail and the CCC will
cycle around repeatedly installing the firmware.   To solve this issue, remove the "firmware.bak" file from the SD card.

------------------------
1. Intial config display on startup now shows current time, day of week and date. (For a newly built clock these will be incorrect, until
   connected to wi-fi intially and the clock gets the cuttent date and time from the internet.  This takes approximately 1 minute from 
   connecting to the internet).
2. Holding down the "Adv" button on the clock at boot up time, or as the initial config display screens are presented will keep the config      screens displayed. Releasing the "Adv" button, the config displays will remain for a futher 5 seconds, before resuming the start-up
   process. This is useful if I ask you for startup config information when investigating issues.
